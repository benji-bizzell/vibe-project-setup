## Technical Architecture

### Component Overview
```
[ASCII diagram or description of key components and their relationships]
[Component A] → [Component B] → [External System]
```

### Data Flow
```
1. [Step 1 of data/request flow]
2. [Step 2 with processing details]
3. [Step 3 with response handling]
```

### Interface Contracts
```typescript
// Key interfaces and data structures
interface [PrimaryInterface] {
  [field]: [type]
  [method]: ([params]) => [return_type]
}
```

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and architectural reasoning. Explain the chosen approach and why it's optimal for this context.]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Phase Name]

### Phase 1.0: Test Foundation
**Overview**: Write comprehensive tests that define success criteria before implementation begins.

**Changes Required**:
#### Test Infrastructure
**Files**: `tests/[feature-name]/`
**Changes**: Create test files covering all FR requirements for this phase

```typescript
// Example: Tests for Phase 1 requirements (should fail initially)
describe('Phase 1: [Feature Name]', () => {
  describe('FR1.1: [Requirement]', () => {
    it('should [specific behavior]', async () => {
      // This test will fail until Phase 1.1 implementation
      const result = await systemUnderTest.doSomething();
      expect(result).toMatchExpectedBehavior();
    });
  });
});
```

**Success Criteria**:
#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] All Phase 1 requirement tests created and failing appropriately: `npm test`
- [ ] Test infrastructure compiles and runs: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Test coverage matches all Phase 1 FR requirements

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Test scenarios comprehensively cover expected behavior
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions included in tests
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable

### Phase 1.1: Implementation
**Overview**: Implement functionality until all Phase 1.0 tests pass.

**Changes Required**:
#### Implementation Files
**Files**: `src/[feature-area]/`
**Changes**: [Summary of implementation needed to make tests pass]

```typescript
// Example: Implementation that makes Phase 1.0 tests pass
export class FeatureImplementation {
  // Actual implementation code
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] All Phase 1.0 tests now pass: `npm test`
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Feature behavior matches requirements when tested manually
- [ ] Performance is acceptable under expected load
- [ ] Error handling works as designed

## Phase 2: [Next Phase Name]

### Phase 2.0: Test Foundation
**Overview**: Write tests for Phase 2 requirements building on Phase 1 foundation.

**Changes Required**:
[Similar structure to Phase 1.0 with tests for Phase 2 requirements]

### Phase 2.1: Implementation
**Overview**: Implement Phase 2 functionality until all Phase 2.0 tests pass.

**Changes Required**:
[Similar structure to Phase 1.1 with implementation details]

[Continue with additional phases as needed...]

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development Approach
This specification follows a **Phase X.0 → Phase X.1** pattern where tests are written before implementation:

1. **Phase X.0 (Test Foundation)**: Write comprehensive tests covering all FR requirements for the phase
2. **Phase X.1 (Implementation)**: Implement functionality until all Phase X.0 tests pass
3. **Verification**: Success criteria validate both test quality and implementation correctness

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (Phase X.0)
- **FR Requirement Coverage**: Each FR sub-requirement has dedicated test cases
- **Edge Case Validation**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Mock Strategies**: External dependencies isolated for reliable testing

#### Integration Tests (Phase X.0)
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Complete workflows from FR requirements
- **System Boundaries**: API contracts and data flow validation
- **Performance Validation**: NFR thresholds verified through testing

#### Manual Testing Steps (Phase X.1 Verification)
- **Behavior Validation**: Feature works as designed in real scenarios
- **User Experience**: Manual verification of complex interactions
- **Performance**: Real-world load and edge case handling

## Performance Considerations

[Any performance implications, optimizations needed, or constraints to be aware of during implementation]

## Migration Notes

[If applicable, how to handle existing data, systems, or user workflows during the transition]

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| [Specific risk description] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Concrete mitigation strategy] |
| [Another potential risk] | [Impact level] | [Probability] | [How to address/monitor] |
